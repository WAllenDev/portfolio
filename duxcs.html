                <p>DelightUX is a website for a User Experience Designer.  This was a major update to their previous site and posed significant challenges from a technical perspective as well as the difficulties that come with implementing a very specific design.  Prior developers had left a mess of unsupported WordPress plug-ins, themes, and a page builder(Elementor).</p>

                <p>Working directly from the designer's Figma file it was simple to implement their exact vision on full-size screens.  At smaller screens sizes and in portrait the elements did not align in a way that the designer initially found appealing and there is no such thing as a pixel perfect website.</p>

                <p>This project took far longer than initially predicted.  Yet, the final result is something that the designer and myself are both proud of.  With the time that this project took I should have rebuilt the entire site from the ground up.  That final product would have utilized a technology other than WordPress, as this site does not benefit from any of WordPress's strengths and is suffering from its weaknesses, or it would have been a flat HTML/CSS/JS site.</p>
