                <p>Ordino: Time and Task management is an application that I developing on my own relying on Angular for the client and .NET for the server side.  All the TypeScript and C# code is written by me and I designed and managed the SQL database.  It is currently being developed as a web application with the intent of developing a MAUI client for mobile devices.</p>

                <p>Angular is one of the more heavy lifting front end frameworks and I chose it because I have interest in developing enterprise applications.  Microsoft .NET was also chosen for its ability to scale to meet a large business' needs.</p>
